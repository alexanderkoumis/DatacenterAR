# DatacenterAR

Augmented reality datacenter simulation

## Required to build

  * node 0.12+
  * bower
  * ROS Indigo | Jade
    * [LSD_SLAM](https://github.com/tum-vision/lsd_slam)

## Building

```bash
cd $project_dir
npm install
bower install
cd ros_link
node-gyp rebuild
```

## Running

Three processes must be launched to run DatacenterAR:

In one terminal, initiate ROS:

```bash
roscore
```

In another, launch the web app:

```bash
cd $project_dir
iojs app.js
```

When a client connects, images from their webcam, along with camera information are published by `image_transport::ImageTransport`. Broadcast topics `/nodejs_link/image` and `/nodejs_link/camera_info` are then used as input for LSD_SLAM:

```bash
rosrun lsd_slam_core live_slam image:=/nodejs_link/image camera_info:=/nodejs_link/camera_info'
```

Pose estimations are published by LSD_SLAM as `/lsd_slam/pose`, which are sent back to the client's three.js viewer to modify perspective.


## Notes

System works smoothly with modern desktop (~30-45Hz) but slows down to ~5Hz on a mobile due to getUserMedia performance constraints. Eventual implementations of [OffscreenCanvas](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/OffscreenCanvas) or [toBlob()](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=67587#c101) will improve speed on mobile devices.
